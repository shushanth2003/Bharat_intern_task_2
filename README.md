### Titanic Survival Prediction

**Overview:**
The Titanic Survival Prediction project utilizes logistic regression to forecast passenger survival aboard the Titanic. Employing machine learning techniques, this project delves into the factors influencing survival during the historic maritime disaster. By training a logistic regression model on the Titanic dataset, which contains passenger information like age, gender, ticket class, etc., the aim is to accurately predict whether a passenger survived or not. Additionally, a web page has been developed to offer an interactive platform for users to input passenger details and receive survival predictions instantly.

**Web Page Description:**
The web page crafted for the Titanic Survival Prediction project offers a user-friendly interface for predicting passenger survival. Users can input various features such as age, gender, ticket class, etc., and the logistic regression model will assess whether the passenger would have survived the Titanic disaster. The web page ensures accessibility and ease of use, catering to anyone interested in exploring the data and predictions.

**Features of the Web Page:**

**Input Fields:**
- Pclass (Ticket class: 1, 2, or 3)
- Sex (Male or Female)
- Age
- SibSp (Number of siblings/spouses aboard)
- Parch (Number of parents/children aboard)
- Ticket Fare
- Embarked (Port of Embarkation: C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)

**Predict Button:**
- Clicking this button triggers the logistic regression model to make a prediction based on the user-provided input.

**Prediction Result:**
- The prediction result is displayed below the input fields, indicating whether the passenger would have survived or not.

**Project Overview:**
The Titanic Survival Prediction project endeavors to forecast passenger survivability using logistic regression. Training the logistic regression model on the Titanic dataset, which encompasses passenger details such as age, gender, ticket class, etc., the model predicts the likelihood of survival for each passenger based on the available features. The web page interface offers a seamless platform for users to interact with the model, enabling them to input relevant information and receive immediate predictions. Beyond providing insights into the factors influencing survival on the Titanic, this project underscores the application of machine learning in historical data analysis.
